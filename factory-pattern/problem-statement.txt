You're developing a data processing library in Julia that needs to work with various file 
formats (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.). Each file format requires a different parser and data extraction 
method. As the library grows, you anticipate adding support for more file formats.

Design a system using the factory pattern that allows users to create the appropriate parser object 
based on the file type they're working with, without needing to know the specifics of each parser's 
implementation. The system should be easily extensible to accommodate new file formats in the future.
