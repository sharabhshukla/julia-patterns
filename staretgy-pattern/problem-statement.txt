Problem Statement: Online Payment System
You are tasked with developing an online payment system for an e-commerce platform. The system needs to support multiple payment methods, including credit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency. Each payment method has its own unique processing algorithm and validation rules.
Requirements:

The system should allow users to select their preferred payment method at checkout.
New payment methods should be easy to add in the future without modifying existing code.
Each payment method should encapsulate its own processing logic and validation rules.
The core checkout process should remain the same regardless of the chosen payment method.
The system should be flexible enough to allow switching between payment methods at runtime.
Implement the following payment methods initially:

Credit Card: Validate card number, expiration date, and CVV.
PayPal: Redirect to PayPal for authentication and process the payment.
Cryptocurrency: Validate wallet address and process the transaction on the blockchain.



Your task is to design and implement this payment system using the Strategy pattern to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and easy extensibility for future payment methods.
